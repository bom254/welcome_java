Java runs on a JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
Java is platform independent meaning it can run on any machine.
Only requirement is JVM but JVM is not independent.
JVM only understands byte code.

Programmer --> Java code --> Compiler(javac) --> Byte code --> JVM --> JRE(Java Runtime Environment) --> OS(kali linux) --> Hardware

JVM runs the first file that the programmer specifies that has the signature public static void main.

JRM is a combination of JVM and libraries.

Java is WORA meaning Write Once Run Anywhere.

The name of the class should match the name of the Java file.
